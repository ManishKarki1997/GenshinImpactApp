# GenshinImpactApp
Simple Genshin Impact FanApp made with React Native to help farm materials for characters and weapons. Also serves as a database for weapons and characters information.
You can set timers to notify yourself when your resin replenishes or when the parametric transformer is ready to be used again.

You can use the API and make your own applications using the API available here [https://genshin-api.netlify.app/](https://genshin-api.netlify.app)

The app is made using React Native and a custom API made with Node, Express and MongoDB.
